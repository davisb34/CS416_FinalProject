# CS416_FinalProject
   For our final project idea we are proposing making an artist portfolio website. The website will give the artist “about me” page that could include a short biography, a list of previously completed projects and contact information, Contain links to other social media sites. A gallery page that will be dedicated to displaying artwork. The pictures will be stored in a database and displayed in a grid format. Another feature can give a visitor the ability to either buy prints of any artwork featured in the gallery or the visitor can commission the artist via completing a commission form.
